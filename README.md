# FiveMoveMurderFest
This app is a port of a homebrew RPG system (http://www.starshiplad.com/FMMF.pdf) .
It is primarily combat-based, however I plan for campaign managment tools to be added.

# Features(Planned)

*Rudimentry A.I for NPC characters*
*Players declear a move/action for a character. Other side declears counter action, to which non-moved friendlies may again counter-move*
*ect. ect. All actioning characters roll inititave then perform their actions in initave order ,regardless of wheter it can be done by then*
*(E.G shooting at unit 'x' when unit x already shot by unit 'y' in same turn)*

# Skills developing

I plan on this project improving my skills in the following:

>General C#, specifficaly objects, GUI and mouse interactions

>QA and 'client'(I.E my friends) feedback and improvemnt

# Installing and Compiling:

There is currently plans to upload a executable file, however at the moment to run the code you would have to start
a new windows form application in visual studio, and copy over the default files with the attatched.
All images should be saved in the folder 'Pictures'
