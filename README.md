# FiveMoveMurderFest
This app is a port of a homebrew RPG system (http://www.starshiplad.com/FMMF.pdf) .
It is primarily combat-based, however I plan for campaign managment tools to be added.

# Features(Planned)

*Rudimentry A.I for NPC characters*
*Players declear a move/action for a character. Other side declears counter action, to which non-moved friendlies may again counter-move*
*ect. ect. All actioning characters roll inititave then perform their actions in initave order ,regardless of wheter it can be done by then*
*(E.G shooting at unit 'x' when unit x already shot by unit 'y' in same turn)*

# Installing and Compiling:

There is currently plans to upload a executable file, however at the moment to run the code you would have to start
a new windows form application in visual studio, and copy over the default files with the attatched.
All resource's properties should be set to 'copy always' in the explorer

The SQL connection will not work as I have removed my SQL user data

If you have your own SQL database to connect to using mySQL with the correct file names, it will work fine.

All images should be saved in the folder 'Pictures'.
All audio should be saved in the folder 'Audio'
